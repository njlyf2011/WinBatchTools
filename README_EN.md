# Windows Batch Tools

[简体中文](README.md)

This is an open source, free Windows(R) batch file toolkit.

Batch files are not as functional as programs written in C. This project is just a platform for learning.

This toolkit publishes the code by default with the MIT license, as well the PR.

Since the previous license is the GNU GPLv3 license, and my friends has already posted a contribution under the GPLv3 license, so the original license was retained: [LICENSE.GPLv3](LICENSE.GPLv3)

This toolbox is still not perfect, so welcome to submit a PR.

I also hope that everyone can provide translation files.

Windows is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation.
